            <h1> Aliens: Reality or Myth? </h1>
            <p>Since ancient times, we have made a terrible assumption that we exist alone, however, so vast is our universe that it could be the roof for more species such as ourselves or creatures way superior than us... could it be what we call extra-terrestrials? Years have been spent to find them out, yet they provide us glimpses of their presence, bits and pieces of their existence which are covered by organizations for the betterment... <br> However, there are people, who have had their fair chance to witness these superior 'people'... </p>

                <p>Alien life, such as micro organisms, has been hypothesized to exist in the Solar System and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, as well as notable personalities such as Winston Churchill, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth. This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old. Life may have emerged independently at many places throughout the universe. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread—by meteoroids, for example—between habitable planets in a process called panspermia. In any case, complex organic molecules may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of Earth. According to these studies, this process may occur outside Earth on several planets and moons of the Solar System and on planets of other stars.</p>

They spoke in strange tongues and they were very nice to me, but did weird stuff like whispering stuff, poking my nostrils, pulling my mustaché. We were at some desert and i sawd more little guys where they stripped me and covered me with some funny liquid and we danced on the sand singing "Give it Away" and "Hopelessly Devoted to You"... in the morning i was sleeping on the many circles and I walked a long long way home... i swear it was real and if you laugh, ill hit you!</q></p>
